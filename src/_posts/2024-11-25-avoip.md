# Introduction 
I work for the Office of Information Technology at BYU for the audio/visual department which runs an extensive AVoIP network spanning the entire campus. On the class page in Learning Suite, the excellence project states ''Clearly go beyond the basic requirements of the class by learning something related in greater depth" as criteria for a proper excellency project. So, I did just that. I completed two hours of training with my boss in an equipment room solely used for AVoIP in the Marriot Center. The following write up will be an explanation of all the equipment, protocols, and software that goes into the AVoIP network here at BYU.

### Hardware

The Marriott Center Equipment Room contains 4 racks dedicated to Audio Visual and production needs for BYU Broadcasting and AV (my job). There are a few additional racks in a different equipment room in the Marriott Center as well, but the only important piece of equipment there is the Dante Clock Leader, which will be explained later. The following section will contain a brief description of each piece of hardware on the racks I received training on and it's purpose in BYU's AVoIP network at the Marriott.

**Netgear M4250 AV line switches**
Professional Audio Engineers spend a larger percentage of their time working with client experience and live mixing of events and less time in the weeds with their network. At least, that is what they would prefer, thus Netgear's AV line switches are designed with a focus on simplicity and only having what is absolutely necessary for AVoIP. Here is a list of the reasons why the M4250s are used at BYU:
1. Netgear has built, from the ground up, a GUI for these switches that is very beginner friendly.
2. Ports are on the back of the switch to better line up with rack-mounted AV equipment
3. Can run totally fan-less, making it more suitable for ambient sound sensitive environments
4. Extensive PoE capability
5. Plug and play setup style

**MAC Studio**
In the following section a software called QLab will be explained, but what is important to know here is that QLab only runs on Mac OS for the time being. This software is critical for our production team and BYUTV (and sometimes AV) to have replays, screen effects, and slides during live events. Here is a quick breakdown of the MAC server hardware on our racks:
1. 2 DuoModo xMac mini expansion cards with 16TB of M.2 NVMe SSD Storage
2. 1 RackMac Studio enclosure with 2 Mac Studio computers
3. 2 Echo III thunderbolt to PCI-e Expansion Cards 

**SDI Patch panel**
It would be impossible to explain where each of the patches in the system go in this writeup, and I am not sure I even know myself... It is sufficient to say, this is a patch bay that acts much like an ethernet patch panel. Signal paths between the equipment room and control room in the Marriott center are routed to a multitude of devices such as:
- Floor Cameras
- Mixing Boards
- Wall panels
- RF Comm devices

**Dell 3930 Rack**
This entire 1U Dell workstation server rack is purely used to manage a software called Expression, which is critical for production to handle some queuing needs for live sports events. Otherwise, it is pretty underutilized hardware.

**Model 5402 Dante Leader Clock**
An essential piece of hardware kept in a server room separate from the one I inspected on the ground floor of the Marriott center, and locked away behind keycard authenticated doors. This piece of hardware is responsible for being the clock leader for every single device on the AVoIP network of the Marriott center, Lavell Edwards stadium, the Smith Field House and Baseball field. The Model 5402 implements a high-precision IEEE 1588 Precision time protocol server. It also includes a multi band GNSS (satellite) receiver to allow timing reference from GPS, Galileo, and BeiDou. Coming in at about $3,795 to purchase, this thing is the real deal in maintaining consistent and redundant clocking for a time-sensitive network.

**RPio622**
This gigantic I/O box is referred to as a "stage box" in the AV industry because it usually sits on the stage of a venue and as a band comes on to play, they would plug all of their instrument and vocal inputs into this box which then routes the signal back to the mixing board where the audio technician is. This box supports XLR inputs and outputs but can convert the XLR signal into ethernet or fiber so it can be run longer distances to the mixing board in venues like the Marriott center were the mixing board is usually over 500ft away from the stage box. 

**XLR**
XLR is a type of cable commonly used in AV for the following reasons:
- XLR is considered a balanced input, meaning it carries two copies of a signal with one having reversed polarity (differential signaling) so that interference is negated.
- The connector latches on tightly and rarely gets accidentally yanked out ( A crucial feature for cables often laid across live venues)

### Software/Protocols
**Dante**
"Dante is a network platform focusing on AV connectivity that's easy to use", or at least that's what [the folks at Dante say.](https://www.getdante.com/meet-dante/what-is-dante/) Audio visual systems can become niche and proprietary very quick. Each venue is so different from another and the needs can vary drastically, thus many companies have responded to particular needs over the years without much thought for cross-compatibility or future scalability. Dante is an AVoIP solution that builds off of the shoulders of networking principles at the Layer 1 - 4 level, especially Layer 2. By utilizing Ethernet and network switches Dante has established an AV industry standard for all organizations looking to do AVoIP deployments. All devices in our AV network at BYU have Dante support. Most equipment comes with drivers installed and ready to go. Our personal computers utilize a configuration software called Dante Controller to manage patches.

**HDMI**
High Definition Multimedia interface is a consumer focused AV signal transfer protocol. HDMI has about a 50ft signal run length (compared to SDI's 300ft length) before you will need a repeater. HDMI does embed audio signal into video for a synced stream. Often times HDMI is converted into Ethernet in a professional environment in order to reduce the run length of the HDMI cable to a camera. HDMI is best used in controlled, indoor environments at short lengths, which is why this protocol is rarely used in venues like the Marriott Center.

**SDI**
SDI (Serial Digital Interface) utilizes coaxial cables to send high-quality, uncompressed video and audio signals. SDI is resistant to noise and interference, which is why it's such a common choice for AV in live broadcast and production environments like BYU. SDI was first introduced in the 1980s as Standard Definition, then High Definition, then Enhanced Definition, and now Dual Link HD-SDI (supports 1080p and 60 FPS for reference). Dual Link HD-SDI can transfer two video signals at once and in recent years has had it's bandwidth capabilities increased to up to 48Gbps. 48G-SDI is the protocol utilized to reliably produce 8K video streams. It is important to note that audio signal can be embedded in the video signal allowing for synced AV signal from purely SDI, something that is commonly done here at BYU.

**Qlab (MAC only)**
A software used by production engineers to design and sync live lighting, audio, video and cues. Engineers will design and correctly time the entire show before it goes live. QLab supports sending network cues over TCP or UDP, which allows QLab to work with AVoIP. This software provides a large AV team like BYU's to build and practice a show run through on virtualized hardware before ever going live, similar to building a network in GNS3 before producing it.

**Expression (Dell Servers)**
A software similar to QLab that only runs on Windows OS. Expression is used for some specific cueing for the production guys, but is barely used by BYU AV.

**MADI**
MADI Stands for Multichannel Audio Digital Interface. MADI is a digital connection specification that allows 64 audio channels on a single coaxial or fiber-optic cable. MADI is used to connect multitrack recorders and mixing consoles together. The segment length can be up to 100 meters or 3000 meters with Fiber connection. 
### Floor Layout 

<img src="/assets/MarriottFloor.jpeg" width="900" height="600" >

This is a floor map of the Marriott center with labels for all of the panels that connect back to the equipment room. These panels are the outlets of horizontal cabling that connect those who need AV on the floor to the Marriott Center system. The panels have a switch for ethernet devices, fiber inputs for cameras, power connections, and direct XLR.
# Security Concerns

**Disclaimer:** My boss runs a well organized team that has been extremely successful in providing AV services at BYU for years. He knows what he is doing, but has neglected a few security concerns that could pose a major issue should a truly malicious person want to target AV. He understands his circumstances well though, being at BYU, and is partially relying on the trust of the student body to not try anything malicious. Also, in the AV industry, as long as everything works at show time, then life is good!

The security concerns with the Marriott Center AV system are numerous unfortunately.  Here is a quick overview of all the vulnerabilities I could come up with as I toured the equipment room and analyzed the patch panels and network build:
- Zero port security
- No MAC address filtering
- Poor physical security for equipment room and floor panels
- Out of date software packages
- Poor Network Knowledge Redundancy
- Dante controller allows anyone connected to the network to change audio patching routes

Let us break these vulnerabilities down into a brief description of the problem and a potential use case of the vulnerability:

#### Zero port security and MAC Address Filtering
The switches on the floor of the Marriott center have absolutely no port security or MAC filtering and anyone can walk up to them. Essentially, if a person has an Ethernet cable and a laptop, they have access to the AV network. 

**Use Case:** If a hacker wanted to, they could sneak up to the panel during a live broadcast like devotional and DoS the network, thus crashing the broadcast completely.

#### Poor physical security for equipment room
The equipment room itself is in a section of the Marriott Center only accessible by those with credentials, or a BYU polo and some charisma, within the tunnel on the floor. And although this section of the Marriott Center is harder to get to for the average Joe, we get around all the time just by looking like BYU employees. There is no authentication going on. The actual room that hosts all of the equipment mentioned in this writeup is completely unlocked. 

**Use Case:** If someone wanted to just wreak havoc, they would go in there and unplug everything, literally everything. This would take so much time to recover from and any live events in the Marriott Center that day or even week would be completely unable to broadcast or use the sound system/cameras. A more sophisticated attack could include installing a slow moving, discrete malware on one of the servers that offloads data, pirates streams, causes a ransomware attack, or sets a logic bomb to kill the system during specific, high profile events like a football game or a devotional.

#### Out of date software packages
Due to previous issues with software being incompatible with the Mac OS and Window OS updates, the AV team no longer does OS updates until all the software used is compatible with an OS version. This means operating systems are sometimes not updated until up to a year after the update releases!

**Use Case:** It is pretty easy to find the OS version of a computer once you have access to it. Should a malicious hacker gain access to the network through one of the above methods or any other and find out the OS is out of date, they can pull from a much larger vulnerability database to wreck the system with.

#### Poor Network Knowledge Redundancy
This one is a bit ridiculous but it needs to be thrown in here. BYU AV has a systems engineer of sorts who builds out the routing for the Marriott Center, and according to my boss, he is the only guy who really knows how everything is routed. This may not be so much a security vulnerability as a redundancy concern. What happens if he dies tomorrow and then something breaks the next day? 

#### Dante Controller 
Dante controller is a free software that allows anyone with a laptop and an ethernet cable to make adjustments to the audio device patching. This is really a great help on systems as big and spread out as the Marriott Center. But do you see the problem? There is no authentication involved and anyone can make those changes.

**Use Case:** A hacker walks into the Marriott Center through portal K and walks into the audio booth, which is unlocked, and plugs his computer in. He proceeds to un-patch every single device on the network, rendering it useless for the Tuesday devotional that starts in four hours. The audio engineers now have to repatch all necessary devices. This may delay the event, but would better be used a distraction to get into the equipment room while everyone is trying to fix the patching.

#### Solution
A solution to a lot of these issues is a software called *Dante Domain Manager* which implements authentication for changing patching and allows for simple MAC address filtering and port security on connected switches. Outside of installing Domain Manager, the equipment room really should be locked behind keycards that only employees have the capability to use. This room is just too important to leave unlocked for anyone to access.
# Conclusion

The AVoIP network at BYU is integral to maintaining the consistent quality of BYU's AV efforts, supporting everything from devotionals to football games. The current system provides ease of use and exceptional functionality for the team. However, it faces notable security risks that could result in critical failures or data loss if left unaddressed. The most effective solutions include investing in Dante Domain Manager for enhanced authentication and implementing stronger physical security measures for the equipment. This project has provided me with useful insights into the equipment I utilize at work while also giving me the opportunity to see network security vulnerabilities play out in a real world scenario. It is important to note, that my training with my boss and discussion of these vulnerabilities with him has led to a plan to implement countermeasures to the security vulnerabilities mentioned in this article. Purchasing Dante Domain Manager will be the first step.
