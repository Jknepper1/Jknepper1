Welcome to my website that probably looks like 1000 other websites built by people just getting their hands dirty with web development. I have big plans for this website that will get progressively less interesting to my friends and family and more and moerr interesting to future employers, colleagues, and others interested in InfoSec. 

This website is built using the Jekyll SSG (Static Site Generator) and hosted on GitHub pages for free. If you are interested in seeing the source code for this web page please view the repository here [Link to Repo](https://github.com/).
